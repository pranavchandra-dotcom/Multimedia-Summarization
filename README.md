# Multimedia-Summarization

Developed a deep learning model leveraging BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to create concise summaries of multimedia content, including audio, video, and text. 
This project addresses the increasing reliance on OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms by providing users with quick, informative overviews of large multimedia libraries. 
The model enhances user experience by speeding up the search and efficient access to video data, enabling users to determine the usefulness of content rapidly. 
The model achieved notable performance metrics, including a 68% accuracy on Rouge1, 52% on Rouge2, and 63% on RougeL evaluations.
